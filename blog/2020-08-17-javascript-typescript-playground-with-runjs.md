RunJS is a modern JavaScript playground with support for both Babel and TypeScript. With RunJS, you can quickly validate your ideas, it will auto-evaluate the code as you type. RunJS comes with built-in support for browser and NodeJS.

Let's see it in action:

RunJS also allows you to install npm packages and use them in the editor. You can choose **Action > Install NPM packages.**
